## Question
What is alcohol dehydrogenase? Which is its evolutive history and how was it discovered? How does it act in humans and how many and which types of alcohol dehydrogenase do exist?
## Answer
# Alcohol Dehydrogenase

## Overview

Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) are a diverse family of enzymes that play a crucial role in the metabolism of alcohols, primarily by catalyzing the reversible oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde while reducing a pyridine nucleotide. They are integral to various biological processes, including detoxification of ingested alcohols and metabolic pathways associated with plant and animal physiology. The evolutionary history of these enzymes showcases a complex interplay of gene duplications, structural variations, and functional adaptations across different species.

## Classification

ADHs are classified into several distinct classes based on their structural and functional characteristics. The classical liver alcohol dehydrogenase, classified as a class I enzyme, represents an emerging form of ADH that exhibits structural stability throughout much of the vertebrate lineage. In contrast, class III enzymes, which are present in diverse organisms such as plants, eukaryotic microorganisms, and prokaryotic bacteria, derive from a glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase lineage. This evolutionary divergence highlights the differences in enzymatic activity and specificity, with class I ADH primarily responsible for ethanol metabolism, whereas class III ADH has functions related to formaldehyde and aldehyde processing [C:\Users\user\data\Alcohol_dehydrogenase\Enzymogenesis\ classical liver alcohol dehydrogenase origin from the glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase line..pdf].

## Evolutionary History

The evolutionary trajectory of ADH can be traced back to a common ancestral gene, which underwent duplications leading to the diversification of functions associated with different classes of ADH. In vertebrates, it has been observed that early duplications resulted in significant structural variations and functional adaptations, contributing to the metabolic importance of ADH in various organisms. For example, comparative studies between horse liver ADH and yeast ADH have revealed conservation of functionally important sequences despite the significant evolutionary distance. Notably, different classes exhibit differing rates of evolutionary change, with class I ADH showing a three-fold higher rate of residue replacement compared to class III [C:\Users\user\data\Alcohol_dehydrogenase\ Evaluation of the impact of functional diversification on Poaceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, and Pinaceae alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes.pdf].

## Enzyme Structure and Function

Proteins within the ADH family possess varying degrees of structural and functional homology. For instance, horse liver ADH has been well characterized through crystallography, revealing crucial insights into its enzymatic mechanisms. Many animal forms of ADH, including various isozymes found in humans, require zinc as a cofactor for activity [C:\Users\user\data\Alcohol_dehydrogenase\ Homology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ADH4 to an iron-activated alcohol dehydrogenase from Zymomonas mobilis.pdf]. Notably, distinct forms of ADH, such as the YADH isoforms in baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), serve specific metabolic roles depending on the organism's environmental conditions [C:\Users\user\data\Alcohol_dehydrogenase\ The three zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenases from baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.pdf].

## Biochemical Roles

ADHs are involved in detoxification processes and the elimination of low molecular weight reactive substances. In mammals, class I ADHs localize primarily to the liver and have significant roles in ethanol metabolism. Different allelic variants of the ADH genes—ADH1A, ADH1B, and ADH1C—generate protein subunits that combine to form functional dimers or heterodimers. The presence of these allelic variations contributes to an individual's susceptibility to alcohol use disorders (AUDs), with specific variants exhibiting protective roles against ethanol toxicity [C:\Users\user\data\Alcohol_dehydrogenase\ Incorporation of the Genetic Control of Alcohol Dehydrogenase into a Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Model for Ethanol in Humans.pdf].

In plants, ADHs participate in metabolic pathways associated with fruit ripening and are influenced by environmental factors such as hypoxia and drought, which can induce transcriptional activation of ADH genes [C:\Users\user\data\Alcohol_dehydrogenase\ Evaluation of the impact of functional diversification on Poaceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, and Pinaceae alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes.pdf]. Studies have shown that the structural efficiency and functional capabilities of these enzymes differ significantly among species, contributing to their respective fitness in varied ecological niches.

## Conclusion

Overall, the intricate evolutionary history, structural diversity, and biochemical roles of alcohol dehydrogenases underscore their central importance not only in metabolic pathways but also in the adaptation to environmental changes across a broad spectrum of taxa. Future research will further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the enzymatic activities of ADHs and their implications for health, disease, and ecological dynamics [C:\Users\user\data\Alcohol_dehydrogenase\ Alcohol dehydrogenases, aldehyde dehydrogenases and alcohol use disorders: a critical review.pdf].

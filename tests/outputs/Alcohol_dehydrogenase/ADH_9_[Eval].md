## Question
What is alcohol dehydrogenase? Which is its evolutive history and how was it discovered? How does it act in humans and how many and which types of alcohol dehydrogenase do exist?
## Answer
# Alcohol Dehydrogenase

## Overview

Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is a crucial enzyme in the metabolism of alcohols and aldehydes, primarily catalyzing the reversible oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde via the reduction of a pyridine nucleotide. It is classified into several classes and isoforms, which are distinguished based on structural and functional characteristics. ADH plays a significant role in various physiological processes across different species, emphasizing its importance in both cellular metabolism and toxicological responses.

## Classification and Isoforms

ADH enzymes are categorized into multiple classes, with classes I, II, III, and IV being the most studied. Class I ADH, common in vertebrates, is composed of subunits encoded by three genes: ADH1A, ADH1B, and ADH1C, which can form various homo- and heterodimers based on their sequence homology exceeding 90% [C:\Users\user\data\Alcohol_dehydrogenase\ In­corporation of the Genetic Control of Alcohol Dehydrogenase into a Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Model for Ethanol in Humans.pdf]. Notably, the evolutionary paths of these enzymes suggest that their functions diversified significantly due to gene duplications and modifications over time.

Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of distinct isoforms of ADH in various organisms, including mammals, yeast, and plants. For instance, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* showcases three isoenzymes of ADH: YADH-1, YADH-2, and YADH-3, with YADH-1 being the major form expressed during anaerobic fermentation [C:\Users\user\data\Alcohol_dehydrogenase\The three zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenases from baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.pdf]. Additionally, the emergence of different isozyme forms is attributed to gene duplications at different evolutionary stages, highlighting the complex evolutionary landscape of ADH enzymes.

## Structure and Mechanism

The structural understanding of alcohol dehydrogenases has advanced significantly, revealing that these enzymes typically consist of dimeric and tetrameric forms depending on the class. For example, human class I ADHs exist as dimeric enzymes, while yeast ADHs are often tetrameric [C:\Users\user\data\Alcohol_dehydrogenase\Alcohol Dehydrogenase of Class IV (σσ-ADH) from Human Stomach.pdf]. The active sites of ADHs contain crucial residues that facilitate their catalytic functions through interactions with coenzymes like NAD+. Specific structural variations among isoforms can lead to significant differences in enzymatic activities and substrate affinities.

Research has shown that there are evolutionary links between the structures of different ADHs, demonstrating that both class I and class III enzymes may have arisen from earlier forms that displayed similarities in their enzyme activities [C:\Users\user\data\Alcohol_dehydrogenase\Enzymogenesis   classical liver alcohol dehydrogenase origin from the glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase line..pdf]. This implies that their functionality is a product of convergent evolution, where independent evolutionary paths lead to similar enzyme capabilities in different taxa.

## Biochemical Functions

The foremost role of ADH enzymes is in the detoxification of alcohol. In the liver, the classical liver alcohol dehydrogenase (class I ADH) is predominant in ethanol metabolism. It exhibits a wide range of substrate specificity that allows it to metabolize not just ethanol but also other primary alcohols and various carbonyl compounds [C:\Users\user\data\Alcohol_dehydrogenase\Evaluation of the impact of functional diversification on Poaceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, and Pinaceae alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes.pdf]. In contrast, class III ADH has a more limited biochemical profile and is notably ineffective in the oxidation of ethanol, displaying a preference for long-chain primary alcohols.

Moreover, variations in ADH have been associated with alcohol use disorders (AUD). Notably, specific polymorphisms in the ADH1B gene can influence individual susceptibility to alcohol dependence, with certain variants being protective in different population groups [C:\Users\user\data\Alcohol_dehydrogenase\Alcohol dehydrogenases, aldehyde dehydrogenases and alcohol use disorders: a critical review.pdf]. This is particularly relevant in diverse populations, where genetic variations can dictate metabolic efficiencies and risks associated with alcohol consumption.

## Conclusions and Future Directions

The multifaceted nature of alcohol dehydrogenases illustrates their critical roles within both metabolic pathways and the context of pharmacogenomics. Advanced understanding of their structure-function relationships has utility across various applications, including the development of therapeutics for alcohol-related conditions and enhancing our comprehension of metabolic syndrome. 

Further investigation into the isoforms, evolutionary trajectories, and detailed kinetic mechanisms of ADH will continue to shed light on the ecological and physiological significance of these essential enzymes. Understanding the fine-tuning of ADH activity could unveil novel approaches in treating metabolic disorders and tailoring therapies that consider individual genotypic differences in enzyme activity. 

Alcohol dehydrogenase remains a vibrant area of research with substantial implications for biology, medicine, and pharmacology.

This comprehensive exploration draws on extensive primary research and emphasizes the evolutionary history and functional complexities of ADH across different organisms.

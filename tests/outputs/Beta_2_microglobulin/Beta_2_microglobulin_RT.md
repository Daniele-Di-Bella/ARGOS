# Beta-2 Microglobulin

## Structure and Function

β2 microglobulin (B2M) is a component of MHC class I molecules. MHC class I molecules have α1, α2, and α3 proteins, which are present on all nucleated cells (excluding red blood cells). In humans, the β2 microglobulin protein is encoded by the *B2M* gene.

β2 microglobulin lies beside the α3 chain on the cell surface. Unlike α3, β2 has no transmembrane region. Directly above β2 (further away from the cell) lies the α1 chain, which itself is next to the α2.

β2 microglobulin associates not only with the alpha chain of MHC class I molecules but also with class I-like molecules such as CD1 (five genes in humans), MR1, the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), and Qa-1 (a form of alloantigen). Nevertheless, the *B2M* gene is outside of the MHC (HLA) locus, on a different chromosome.

An additional function is its association with the HFE protein, which helps regulate hepcidin expression in the liver. Hepcidin targets the iron transporter ferroportin on the basolateral membrane of enterocytes and macrophages for degradation, reducing iron uptake from food and iron release from recycled red blood cells in the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). Loss of this function causes iron excess and hemochromatosis.

During a cytomegalovirus infection, a viral protein binds to β2 microglobulin, preventing MHC class I molecules from assembling and reaching the plasma membrane.

Mouse models deficient in the *B2M* gene demonstrate that β2 microglobulin is necessary for MHC class I surface expression and stability of the peptide-binding groove. In the absence of β2 microglobulin, very few MHC class I molecules can be detected on the surface (bare lymphocyte syndrome or BLS). Without MHC class I, CD8+ T cells cannot develop. CD8+ T cells are a subset of T cells involved in acquired immunity.

## Clinical Significance

In patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis, β2 microglobulin can aggregate into amyloid fibers that deposit in joint spaces, leading to dialysis-related amyloidosis.

Low levels of β2 microglobulin can indicate non-progression of HIV.

Elevated β2 microglobulin levels are observed in multiple myeloma and lymphoma. However, primary amyloidosis (amyloid light chain) and secondary amyloidosis (amyloid-associated protein) are more common in these cases. The normal β2 microglobulin value is < 2 mg/L. In multiple myeloma, β2 microglobulin levels serve as an important prognostic indicator:
- Levels < 4 mg/L correlate with a median survival of 43 months.
- Levels > 4 mg/L correlate with a median survival of 12 months.

However, β2 microglobulin levels cannot distinguish between monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), which has a better prognosis, and smoldering (low-grade) myeloma.

Loss-of-function mutations in *B2M* have been reported in cancer patients unresponsive to immunotherapies.

## Virus Relevance

β2 microglobulin plays a role in viral entry for Coxsackievirus A9 and Vaccinia virus (a Poxvirus). For Coxsackievirus A9, β2 microglobulin is likely required for the transport of its receptor, the Human Neonatal Fc Receptor (FcRn), to the plasma membrane. However, its specific function in Vaccinia virus infection remains unclear.

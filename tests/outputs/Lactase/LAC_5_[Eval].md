## Question
What is Lactase? How is it used (mention food use, medial use and industrial use)? Which is its function mechanism? Which is its structure and how is it synthesized? How lactase is genetically expressed and regulated?
## Answer
**Lactase**

Lactase, also known as lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH), is an enzyme crucial for the hydrolysis of lactose, the primary carbohydrate found in milk. This enzyme is primarily produced in the brush border of the small intestine and breaks down lactose into its constituent monosaccharides, glucose and galactose, facilitating their absorption into the bloodstream [data\Lactase\UCM400718.pdf.pdf]. 

**Biochemistry and Function**

The enzymatic activity of lactase is categorized as both lactase and phlorizin hydrolase, corresponding to its ability to hydrolyze not only lactose but also phlorizin, a glycoside. It operates through two distinct active sites located on the same polypeptide chain, allowing it to fulfill its dual functions effectively [data\Lactase\Adult-type hypolactasia and regulation of lactase expression.pdf]. The lactase enzyme is encoded by the LCT gene, which expression varies significantly among different populations and developmental stages [data\Lactase\Adult-type hypolactasia and regulation of lactase expression.pdf].

During infancy, lactase expression is high, as breast milk provides the predominant energy source. In most mammals, however, lactase levels decline post-weaning, leading to what is known as adult-type hypolactasia or lactose intolerance in later life [data\Lactase\Adult-type hypolactasia and regulation of lactase expression.pdf]. Interestingly, a subset of the human population, particularly those of Northern European descent, retain lactase persistence into adulthood, allowing them to digest lactose without discomfort [data\Lactase\Adult-type hypolactasia and regulation of lactase expression.pdf].

**Genetic Regulation**

The regulation of lactase expression is primarily transcriptional, with genetic factors playing a significant role in determining whether an individual becomes lactose intolerant or remains lactase persistent. Numerous studies have identified mutations associated with lactase persistence that enhance the transcriptional activity of the lactase promoter [data\Lactase\Adult-type hypolactasia and regulation of lactase expression.pdf]. For instance, the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has been correlated with the ability to digest lactose into adulthood, indicating the complex interplay of genetics and diet [data\Lactase\Adult-type hypolactasia and regulation of lactase expression.pdf].

**Sources of Lactase**

Lactase is widely found in various organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, molds, and mammals. Commercially important sources of lactase include fungi such as *Aspergillus oryzae* and *Aspergillus niger*, as well as yeasts like *Kluyveromyces marxianus* [data\Lactase\Production of Lactase by Trichoderma sp..pdf]. Advances in biotechnology have facilitated the production of lactase through recombinant techniques, allowing for efficient enzyme manufacture on an industrial scale [data\Lactase\Production of Lactase by Trichoderma sp..pdf].

**Applications in Food Industry**

The primary application of lactase in the food industry is in the production of lactose-free milk and dairy products. By enzymatically hydrolyzing lactose, lactase allows individuals with lactose intolerance to consume dairy products without adverse gastrointestinal effects [data\Lactase\UCM400718.pdf.pdf]. This is particularly significant in regions where dairy is a staple food item, yet a large portion of the population suffers from lactose intolerance. Besides direct applications in milk, hydrolyzed lactose is used in the production of ice cream, yogurt, and baked goods, improving creaminess and texture while eliminating the undesirable sandiness associated with unprocessed lactose [data\Lactase\UCM400718.pdf.pdf].

Furthermore, the enzymatic hydrolysis of whey, a byproduct of cheese production, can transform this waste product into a valuable resource for food applications [data\Lactase\Production of Lactase by Trichoderma sp..pdf]. Lactase-treated whey has potential uses in confections andIce cream products, enhancing sweetness and reducing crystallization issues often related to lactose [data\Lactase\UCM400718.pdf.pdf]. 

**Conclusion**

Lactase not only plays a fundamental role in dairy digestion but also holds immense significance in the food industry through its ability to transform lactose-rich products into digestible forms for those with lactose intolerance. As research advances, further understanding of lactase’s biochemical properties, regulatory mechanisms, and diverse applications continues to pave the way for innovations in health and nutrition, benefiting lactose-intolerant populations globally. Understanding the genetic basis of lactase expression, alongside the development of novel production methods, ensures the sustained supply of this vital enzyme for food applications [data\Lactase\Adult-type hypolactasia and regulation of lactase expression.pdf].

# Lactase

## Introduction

Lactase, also known as lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH), is a critical enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of lactose, a disaccharide sugar present in milk, into its constituent monosaccharides: glucose and galactose. This enzyme plays an essential role in human digestion, particularly in infants and individuals with lactose persistence. However, in many adults, lactase activity declines significantly, resulting in lactose intolerance or adult-type hypolactasia. This article examines the biochemistry, production, regulation, and industrial applications of lactase, alongside its implications for human health.

## Biochemistry of Lactase

The lactase enzyme operates primarily in the small intestine and is encoded by the gene LCT. It exhibits two distinct enzymatic activities: lactase activity (EC 3.2.1.108), responsible for breaking down lactose, and phlorizin hydrolase activity (EC 3.2.1.62), which cleaves glycosides including phlorizin. The enzyme facilitates the absorption of glucose and galactose across the intestinal epithelium, thereby allowing for effective digestion of lactose-containing foods [data\Lactase\Adult-type hypolactasia and regulation of lactase expression.pdf].

Lactase is composed of approximately 1,927 amino acids and possesses a complex structure with various functional domains that allow its enzymatic functions. These domains include a cleavable signal peptide essential for cellular transport, a pro-region that assists in folding, and a membrane anchor that ensures the enzyme is embedded in the intestinal brush border [data\Lactase\Complete primary structure of human and rabbit lactase-phlorizin hydrolase implications for biosynthesis, membrane anchoring and evolution of the enzyme..pdf].

## Production and Applications

The production of lactase enzymes is not only important for human digestion but has significant industrial applications as well. Lactase can be derived from various sources, including yeasts such as *Kluyveromyces lactis*, molds like *Aspergillus niger*, and bacterial strains such as *Lactobacillus* [data\Lactase\Production of Lactase by Trichoderma sp..pdf]. The enzyme is particularly utilized in the dairy industry to produce lactose-free milk and other dairy products, thereby catering to individuals with lactose intolerance. By hydrolyzing lactose into glucose and galactose, lactase makes milk and dairy products easier to digest for lactose-intolerant individuals [data\Lactase\UCM400718.pdf.pdf].

The economic significance of lactase is evident in its application beyond dairy. For instance, concentrated whey, a by-product of cheese production containing high lactose levels, can be effectively utilized in the food industry as an ingredient in bakery products, ice cream, and dressings after being treated with lactase [data\Lactase\UCM400718.pdf.pdf].

## Lactase Regulation and Genetic Factors

Lactase expression is regulated at a genetic level. In many mammals, lactase activity declines after weaning, as lactose is removed from the diet. However, in certain populations, particularly those of Northern European descent, lactase activity persists into adulthood, allowing for continued consumption of lactose-containing foods without gastrointestinal distress [data\Lactase\Adult-type hypolactasia and regulation of lactase expression.pdf]. This genetic persistence is attributed to regulatory variants located near the LCT gene, suggesting that the expression levels of lactase are dominantly inherited [data\Lactase\The genetically programmed down-regulation of lactase in children.pdf].

The drop in lactase activity in adulthood is termed adult-type hypolactasia, a condition affecting a significant number of individuals globally, resulting in symptoms like diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain upon the intake of lactose-rich foods. Characterizing and understanding the enzymatic pathway and genetic regulation of lactase has been a subject of intense research, primarily focusing on its biosynthesis, glycosylation, and transport within the intestinal cells [data\Lactase\Adult-type hypolactasia and regulation of lactase expression.pdf].

## Conclusion

The lactase enzyme is fundamental to the digestion of lactose in humans, with far-reaching implications for nutrition, health, and food science. As research continues to uncover its complex regulation and potential applications in various industries, the role of lactase will only grow in importance. Understanding lactase's biochemistry, production pathways, and the genetics that govern its expression may lead to enhanced dietary strategies for those affected by lactose intolerance, along with innovations in food production and biotechnology.

# Evaluation
GEval 4o correctness score: 0.6756404715358609<br>Reason: The actual output covers key topics like the biochemistry, production, application, and regulation of lactase. However, it lacks detailed coverage of the function mechanism and specific industrial and medical uses throughout the output. The structure and genetics sections are well-represented but the mechanism detail, as expected, is insufficient. References in actual output do not match the expected names. Overall structure is coherent with good readability.

GEval 4o-mini correctness score: 0.6776545255735865<br>Reason: The actual output provides detailed information about lactase's structure, function, and regulation but lacks emphasis on the distinct food, medical, and industrial uses as clearly outlined in the expected output. Some details about the catalytic mechanism are also present in the actual output but are not sufficiently highlighted per the evaluation criteria.

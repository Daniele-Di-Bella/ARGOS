https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39344613/,"To explore the clinical and genetic characteristics of two children with Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) due to variants of TANC2 gene. Clinical data of two children who were admitted to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University respectively in April 2020 and April 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Peripheral blood samples of the children and their parents were collected and subjected to whole exome sequencing. Candidate variants were verified by Sanger sequencing. By using ""TANC2 gene"", ""Neurodevelopmental disorders"", ""Nervous system development disorders"", ""TANC2"" as the key words, similar cases were searched from the CNKI, Wanfang database platform and PubMed database, with the search time set as from the establishment of the database to December 2023. This study was approved by the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University (Ethics No. 2020-57). Case 1 was a 1-year-and-3-month-old girl who had developed convulsions at 1 year old and had three episodes of seizures. Her epilepsy had resolved with the treatment of oxcarbazepine, which was stopped at the age of 2-year-and-7-month. Her language, movement and intelligence development were all normal. Case 2 was a 1-year-and-10-month-old boy, who had developed convulsions at 1 year old. His seizure type was myoclonus, and the frequency was dozens of times a day. His epilepsy had resolved with the treatment of sodium valproate. His language, movement and intelligence development was delayed for about half a year. Genetic analysis showed that both children had harbored novel variants of the TANC2 gene (NM_025185.4), including c.3398G>A (p.Gly1133Glu) and c.2829+1G>A, respectively. Based on the guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), the former was rated as likely pathogenic (PS2+PM2_Supporting+PP3) and the latter was rated as pathogenic (PVS1+PS2+PM2_Supporting). Two previous reports were retrieved, which had involved 17 cases and 16 variants. Common features had included autism spectrum disorder (70.6%, 12/17) , intellectual disability (94.1%,16/17) , language and motor retardation (88.2%, 15/17；58.8%, 10/17), facial dysmorphism, epilepsy, ataxia, and thoracic and spinal deformities. Variants of the TANC2 gene probably underlay the epilepsy and development delay in these children with NDDs.",0.0845166806656851
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38874360/,"Oncogenic HPV E6 proteins have a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) which plays important roles in both the viral life cycle and tumor development. The PBM confers interaction with a large number of different PDZ domain-containing substrates, one of which is Sorting Nexin 27. This protein is part of the retromer complex and plays an important role in endocytic sorting pathways. It has been shown that at least two SNX27 interacting partners, GLUT1 and TANC2, are aberrantly trafficked due to the E6 PBM-dependent interaction with SNX27. To investigate further which other components of the endocytic trafficking pathway might be affected by the SNX27-HPV E6 interaction, we analyzed the SNX27 proteome interaction profile in a previously described HeLa cell line expressing GFP-SNX27, both in the presence and absence of the HPV-18 E6 oncoprotein. In this study, we identify a novel interacting partner of SNX27, secreted glycoprotein EMILIN2, whose release is blocked by HPV18 E6 in a PBM-dependent manner. Mechanistically, E6 can block EMILIN2 interaction with the WNT1 ligand, thereby enhancing WNT1 signaling and promoting cell proliferation. This study demonstrates that HPV E6 blocks EMILIN2 inhibition of WNT1 signaling, thereby enhancing cell proliferation in HPV-positive tumor cells. This involves a novel mechanism whereby the E6 PBM actually contributes toward enhancing the interaction between SNX27 and EMILIN2, suggesting that the mode of recognition of SNX27 by E6 and EMILIN2 is different. This is the first example of the E6 PBM altering a PDZ domain-containing protein to enhance potential substrate recognition.",0.015976121024688705

Recent studies indicated TANC1 and TANC2 are candidate genes of several neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). In this study, we identified and characterized a novel interaction between Tanc1/2 and Myo18a, mediated by the Tanc1/2 TPR domains and Myo18a coiled-coil domain and C-extension (CCex). Sequence analysis and size exclusion chromatography experiments reveal that high salt disrupts the interaction between Myo18a and Tanc1/2, indicating that the interaction is primarily driven by charge-charge interactions. More importantly, we found that the Tanc1-TPR/Myo18a CCex interaction could undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in both cultured cells and test tubes, which provides the biochemical basis and potential molecular mechanisms for the LLPS-mediated interactions between Myo18a and Tanc1/2.",0.05406738166191497

However, it has been scarcely studied, especially in rabbits. The objectives of the present study were, first, to assess the importance of MGE on intramuscular fat and fatty acid composition by applying a Bayesian maternal animal model in two rabbit lines divergently selected for IMF. The second objective was to identify genomic regions and candidate genes of MGE that are associated with the traits of these offspring, using Bayesian methods in a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS). Quantitative analyses were performed using data from 1982 rabbits, and 349 animals from the 9th generation and 76 dams of the 8th generation with 88,512 SNPs were used for the GWAS. The studied traits were IMF, saturated fatty acids (total SFA, C14:0; myristic acid, C16:0; palmitic acid and C18:0; stearic acid), monounsaturated fatty acids (total MUFA, C16:1n-7; palmitoleic acid and C18:1n-9; oleic acid), polyunsaturated fatty acids (total PUFA, C18:2n-6; linoleic acid, C18:3n-3; α-linolenic acid and C20:4n-6; arachidonic acid), MUFA/SFA and PUFA/SFA. The proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the maternal genetic effect ranged from 8 to 22% for IMF, depending on the model. For fatty acid composition, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by maternal genetic effects varied from 10% (C18:0) to 46% (MUFA) in a model including both direct and additive maternal genetic effects, together with the common litter effect as a random variable. In particular, there were significant direct maternal genetic correlations for C16:0, C18:1n9, C18:2n6, SFA, MUFA, and PUFA with values ranging from -0.53 to -0.89.

Several studies have reported that the TGF-β pathway plays a double-sided role in HF. Therefore, TGF-β-related genes (TRGs) may be potential therapeutic targets for cardiac hypertrophy and HF. However, the roles of TRGs in HF at the single-cell level remain unclear. In this study, to analyze the expression pattern of TRGs during the progress of cardiac hypertrophy and HF, we used three public single-cell RNA sequencing datasets for HF (GSE161470, GSE145154, and GSE161153), one HF transcriptome data (GSE57338), and one hypertrophic cardiomyopathy transcriptome data (GSE141910). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), functional enrichment analysis and machine learning algorithms were used to filter hub genes. Transverse aortic constriction mice model, CCK-8, wound healing assay, quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting were used to validate bioinformatics results. We observed that cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) and endothelial cells showed high TGF-β activity during the progress of HF. Three modules (royalblue, brown4, and darkturquoize) were identified to be significantly associated with TRGs in HF. Six hub genes (TANC2, ADAMTS2, DYNLL1, MRC2, EGR1, and OTUD1) showed anomaly trend in cardiac hypertrophy. We further validated the regulation of the TGF-β-MYC-ADAMTS2 axis on CFs activation  This study identified six hub genes (TANC2, ADAMTS2, DYNLL1, MRC2, EGR1, and OTUD1) by integrating scRNA and transcriptome data.

In humans, tanc2 mutations have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other related neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the role of tanc2 in neurodevelopment and in controlling behaviors are not fully understood. Here, we generated and characterized a tanc2 knockout allele in zebrafish. Loss of tanc2 increases the larval brain size and body length by promoting proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. We observed that the glutamatergic neuron population is significantly increased in tanc2 mutants while the GABAergic and the glycinergic neurons are not affected, suggesting that an excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance. Indeed, the tanc2 knockout larvae exhibited increase sleep. In adult zebrafish, the mutants display anxiolytic-behavior, reduced aggression, and impaired social preference. The alterations in these behaviors are phenotypically similar to the ASD patients carrying tanc2 mutations. Therefore, the tanc2 knockout allele could serve as a valuable model to further study the role of tanc2 in the nervous system.",0.3127767607335062
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36326272/,"Cancer-causing HPV E6 oncoproteins contain a PDZ-binding motif at the extreme carboxy terminus, which plays an important role in the viral life cycle and in the development of malignancy. Through this motif, HPV E6 targets a large number of cellular substrates, many of which are involved in processes related to the regulation of cell polarity. Recent studies also demonstrated E6's PDZ binding motif (PBM)-dependent association with SNX27, with a potential role in the perturbation of endocytic transport. Here, we have performed a proteomic analysis to identify SNX27-interacting partners whose binding to SNX27 is specifically perturbed in an E6-dependent manner. Extracts of HeLa cells that express GFP-tagged SNX27, transfected with control siRNA or siRNA targeting E6AP, were subject to GFP immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectroscopy, which identified TANC2 as an interacting partner of SNX27. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HPV E6 inhibits association between SNX27 and TANC2 in a PBM-dependent manner, resulting in an increase in TANC2 protein levels. In the absence of E6, SNX27 directs TANC2 toward lysosomal degradation. TANC2, in the presence of HPV-18E6, enhances cell proliferation in a PBM-dependent manner, indicating that HPV E6 targets the SNX27-mediated transport of TANC2 to promote cellular proliferation.

Although multiple prognostic-related genes gave been explored in previous studies, there are still many genes whose prognostic value remains unclear. In this study, a total of 1532 AML patients from three GEO databases were included, five genes with potential prognostic value (DLC1, NF1B, DENND5B, TANC2 and ELAVL4) were screened by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). Based on this, we conducted survival analysis of the above five genes through the TCGA database and found that low level of DLC1 was detrimental to the long-term prognosis of AML patients. We also performed external validation in 48 AML patients from our medical center to analyze the impact of DLC1 level on prognosis.

Rare tetratricopeptide repeat, ankyrin repeat and coiled-coil containing 2 (TANC2)-disrupting variants were disease causing in NDD patients. The post-synaptic scaffold protein TANC2 is essential for dendrite formation in synaptic plasticity and plays an unclarified but critical role in development. We here report a novel homozygous-viable Tanc2-disrupted function model in which mutant mice were hyperactive and had impaired sensorimotor gating consistent with NDD patient psychiatric endophenotypes. Yet, a multi-systemic analysis revealed the pleiotropic effects of Tanc2 outside the brain, such as growth failure and hepatocellular damage. This was associated with aberrant liver function including altered hepatocellular metabolism. Integrative analysis indicates that these disrupted Tanc2 systemic effects relate to interaction with Hippo developmental signalling pathway proteins and will increase the risk for comorbid somatic disease. This highlights how NDD gene pleiotropy can augment medical comorbidity susceptibility, underscoring the benefit of holistic NDD patient diagnosis and treatment for which large-scale preclinical functional genomics can provide complementary pleiotropic gene function information.",0.12970601665692766

However, we do not fully understand all of the upstream signaling components that can regulate mTOR signaling, especially in neurons. Here, we show a direct, regulated inhibition of mTOR by Tanc2, an adaptor/scaffolding protein with strong neurodevelopmental and psychiatric implications. While Tanc2-null mice show embryonic lethality, Tanc2-haploinsufficient mice survive but display mTORC1/2 hyperactivity accompanying synaptic and behavioral deficits reversed by mTOR-inhibiting rapamycin. Tanc2 interacts with and inhibits mTOR, which is suppressed by mTOR-activating serum or ketamine, a fast-acting antidepressant. Tanc2 and Deptor, also known to inhibit mTORC1/2 minimally affecting neurodevelopment, distinctly inhibit mTOR in early- and late-stage neurons. Lastly, Tanc2 inhibits mTORC1/2 in human neural progenitor cells and neurons. In summary, our findings show that Tanc2 is a mTORC1/2 inhibitor affecting neurodevelopment.",0.164220619458774

The animals were then genotyped on the BovineSNP50 SNPchip before being imputed to the 600K density and genome wide association study was performed with GCTA software. We found low heritability for REI (h2 = 0.12 in each of the diet phases). Although the phenotypic correlation between the two diet phases was moderate (0.36), the genetic correlation was high (0.83), indicating a common genetic determinism for feed efficiency regardless of the diet. Correlations between REI and slaughter traits were negative regarding muscle-related traits and positive for fat-related traits, indicating that efficient animals generally had a more muscular carcass. It was also seen that feed efficiency was genetically and phenotypically correlated with smaller organs when expressed as a proportion of their empty body weight. From the GWAS analysis, seven QTLs were found to be associated with a trait at the genome-wide level of significance and 18 others at the chromosome-wide level. One important QTL was detected in BTA 2, reflecting the essential effect of the myostatin gene on both carcass composition and relative organ weight. Three QTLs were detected for REI during the maize diet phase on BTA 13, 19, and 28, the latter being significant at the genome-wide level. The QTLs on BTA 19 mapped into the TANC2 gene and the QTLs on BTA 28 into the KIF1BP gene, which are both known to interact with the same protein (KIF1A).

Deletions at 17q23.1q23.2 have been reported in individuals with developmental delay and growth retardation, whereas duplications at 17q23.1q23.2 appear to segregate with clubfoot. Dosage alterations in the TBX2 and TBX4 genes, located in 17q23.2, have been proposed to be responsible for the phenotypes observed in individuals with 17q23.1q23.2 deletions and duplications. In this report, we present the clinical phenotype of a child with a previously unreported de novo duplication at 17q23.2q23.3 located distal to the TBX2 and TBX4 region. We report a 7.5-year-old boy with speech and language disorder, learning difficulties, incoordination, fine motor skill impairment, infrequent seizures with abnormal EEG, and behavior disturbances (mild self-inflicted injuries, hyperactivity-inattention, and stereotyped hand movements). Chromosomal microarray revealed a 2-Mb duplication of chromosome 17q23.2q23.3. Both parents did not have the duplication indicating that this duplication is de novo in the child. The duplicated region encompasses 16 genes. It is possible that increased dosage of one or more genes in this region is responsible for the observed phenotype. The TANC2 gene is one of the genes in the duplicated region.It encodes a member of the TANC (tetratricopeptide repeat, ankyrin repeat and coiled-coil containing) family which includes TANC1 and TANC2. These proteins are highly expressed in brain and play major roles in synapsis regulation. Hence, it is suggestive that TANC2 is the likely candidate gene responsible for the observed phenotype as an increased TANC2 dosage can potentially alter synapsis, resulting in neuronal dysfunction and the neurobehavioral phenotype observed in this child with 17q23.2q23.3 duplication.",0.07380474200534526
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28754924/,"The emergence of genes implicated across multiple comorbid neurologic disorders allows to identify shared underlying molecular pathways. Recently, investigation of patients with diverse neurologic disorders found TANC1 and TANC2 as possible candidate disease genes. While the TANC proteins have been reported as postsynaptic scaffolds influencing synaptic spines and excitatory synapse strength, their molecular functions remain unknown. Here, we conducted a comprehensive in silico analysis of the TANC protein family to characterize their molecular role and understand possible neurobiological consequences of their disruption. The known Ankyrin and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains have been modeled. The newly predicted N-terminal ATPase domain may function as a regulated molecular switch for downstream signaling. Several putative conserved protein binding motifs allowed to extend the TANC interaction network. Interestingly, we highlighted connections with different signaling pathways converging to modulate neuronal activity. Beyond a known role for TANC family members in the glutamate receptor pathway, they seem linked to planar cell polarity signaling, Hippo pathway, and cilium assembly. This suggests an important role in neuron projection, extension and differentiation.",0.02783289631423513
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28030623/,"Muscle fat content is an important phenotypic trait in fish, as it affects the nutritional, technical and sensory qualities of flesh. To identify loci and candidate genes associated with muscle fat content and abdominal fat traits, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the common carp 250 K SNP assay in a common carp F2 resource population. A total of 18 loci surpassing the genome-wide suggestive significance level were detected for 4 traits: fat content in dorsal muscle (MFdo), fat content in abdominal muscle (MFab), abdominal fat weight (AbFW), and AbFW as a percentage of eviscerated weight (AbFP). Among them, one SNP (carp089419) affecting both AbFW and AbFP reached the genome-wide significance level. Ten of those loci were harbored in or near known genes. Furthermore, relative expressions of 5 genes related to MFdo were compared using dorsal muscle samples with high and low phenotypic values. The results showed that 4 genes were differentially expressed between the high and low phenotypic groups. These genes are, therefore, prospective candidate genes for muscle fat content: ankyrin repeat domain 10a (ankrd10a), tetratricopeptide repeat, ankyrin repeat and coiled-coil containing 2 (tanc2), and four jointed box 1 (fjx1) and choline kinase alpha (chka). These results offer valuable insights into the complex genetic basis of fat metabolism and deposition.",0.01906881215207929
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27033726/,"Orofacial clefts (OFCs), which include non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P), are among the most common birth defects in humans, affecting approximately 1 in 700 newborns. CL/P is phenotypically heterogeneous and has a complex etiology caused by genetic and environmental factors. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified at least 15 risk loci for CL/P. As these loci do not account for all of the genetic variance of CL/P, we hypothesized the existence of additional risk loci. We conducted a multiethnic GWAS in 6480 participants (823 unrelated cases, 1700 unrelated controls and 1319 case-parent trios) with European, Asian, African and Central and South American ancestry. Our GWAS revealed novel associations on 2p24 near FAM49A, a gene of unknown function (P = 4.22 × 10",0.0
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24731980/,"Defining the RNA transcriptome in Alzheimer Disease (AD) will help understand the disease mechanisms and provide biomarkers. Though the AD blood transcriptome has been studied, effects of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) were not considered. This study investigated the AD blood transcriptome and accounted for WMH. RNA from whole blood was processed on whole-genome microarrays. A total of 293 probe sets were differentially expressed in AD versus controls, 5 of which were significant for WMH status. The 288 AD-specific probe sets classified subjects with 87.5% sensitivity and 90.5% specificity. They represented 188 genes of which 29 have been reported in prior AD blood and 89 in AD brain studies. Regulated blood genes included MMP9, MME (Neprilysin), TGFβ1, CA4, OCLN, ATM, TGM3, IGFR2, NOV, RNF213, BMX, LRRN1, CAMK2G, INSR, CTSD, SORCS1, SORL1, and TANC2.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24192120/,"Patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension in the HOMED-BP trial were randomly allocated to first-line treatment with a calcium channel blocker (CCB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). We recruited 265 (93 for CCB, 71 for ACEI and 101 for ARB) patients who completed the genomic study. Home blood pressure was measured for 5 days off-treatment before randomization and for 5 days after 2-4 weeks of randomized drug treatment. Genotyping was performed by 500K DNA microarray chips. The blood pressure responses to the three drugs were analyzed separately as a quantitative trait. For replication of SNPs with p < 10(-4), we used the multicenter GEANE study, in which patients were randomized to valsartan or amlodipine. SNPs in PICALM, TANC2, NUMA1 and APCDD1 were found to be associated with CCB responses and those in ABCC9 and YIPF1 were found to be associated with ARB response with replication. Our approach, the first based on high-fidelity phenotyping by home blood pressure measurement, might be a step in moving towards the personalized treatment of hypertension.",0.025299095958342364
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24148822/,"RNA interference has boosted the field of functional genomics, by making it possible to carry out 'loss-of-function' screens in cultured cells. Here, we performed a small interfering RNA screening, in three breast cancer cell lines, for 101 candidate driver genes overexpressed in amplified breast tumors and belonging to eight amplicons on chromosomes 8q and 17q, investigating their role in cell survival/proliferation. This screening identified eight driver genes that were amplified, overexpressed and critical for breast tumor cell proliferation or survival. They included the well-described oncogenic driver genes for the 17q12 amplicon, ERBB2 and GRB7. Four of six other candidate driver genes-RAD21 and EIF3H, both on chromosome 8q23, CHRAC1 on chromosome 8q24.3 and TANC2 on chromosome 17q23-were confirmed to be driver genes regulating the proliferation/survival of clonogenic breast cancer cells presenting an amplification of the corresponding region. Indeed, knockdown of the expression of these genes decreased cell viability, through both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, and inhibited the formation of colonies in anchorage-independent conditions, in soft agar. Strategies for inhibiting the expression of these genes or the function of the proteins they encode are therefore of potential value for the treatment of breast cancers presenting amplifications of the corresponding genomic region.",0.021962392859109617
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21068316/,"PSD-95 (postsynaptic density-95) is thought to play important roles in the regulation of dendritic spines and excitatory synapses, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. TANC1 is a PSD-95-interacting synaptic protein that contains multiple domains for protein-protein interactions but whose function is not well understood. In the present study, we provide evidence that TANC1 and its close relative TANC2 regulate dendritic spines and excitatory synapses. Overexpression of TANC1 and TANC2 in cultured neurons increases the density of dendritic spines and excitatory synapses in a manner that requires the PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1)-binding C termini of TANC proteins. TANC1-deficient mice exhibit reduced spine density in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, but not in the CA1 or dentate gyrus regions, and show impaired spatial memory. TANC2 deficiency, however, causes embryonic lethality. These results suggest that TANC1 is important for dendritic spine maintenance and spatial memory, and implicate TANC2 in embryonic development.",0.10490184388687357
